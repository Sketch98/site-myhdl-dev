====== Modifications to GHDL VPI Examples ======

This was a quick experiment to take the cver VPI implementation, compile it
and load it in GHDL.  The experiment was successful but was a very limited experiment.
Although the VPI was loaded successfully nothing from the VPI interface was accessed.  
Need to do some more experiments to test feasibility of the VPI interface.
