The MEP about [/meps/mep-103] describes a proposal for doing tristates in
MyHDL. The distribution already contains a reference implementation for
modelling and simulation.

What should be investigated is whether and how this proposal can be made
convertible to Verilog and VHDL, and what the possible restrictions are.
