We are looking for help that permits to accomplish much more in less time.
Please choose a task in accordance with your skills. Easier tasks are no less
valuable than harder ones.

Tasks contain unresolved issues, some of which will require hard thinking and
hard work. Use the mailing list or newsgroup to communicate about your
difficulties and ideas to get feedback and help from the community.

When developing code, make sure you understand the development policy described
in the Developer's [/guide].  Take into account that the most difficult part of
a task may be writing the unit test, not necessarily the feature
implementation.  Changesets without unit tests will be accepted.
