This guide is intended for all those who want to help with the development of
this site.

The site is developed using [urubu]. Please consult the [urubu] website to
install the software and get an overview of how it works. As a content
contributor, you don't need all the details about templating and so on: the
main task will be editing content in Markdown format.

The site is being developed on BitBucket in the [site-myhdl-dev-repo].  You can
contribute through pull requests, or I will consider to give you direct access
to the repository.

Publishing the content is automatic after a push, but it may take up to ten
minutes before the edits are online. The website content is pulled from the
repo, so make sure to commit the built website also.

This site has been migrated from on old site. Not all content has been
migrated, but that can still be done if desired.

You can visit the old version of the site under [old.myhdl.org].    The orginal
content has been checked in under `_ori`. There is a `convert.py` script that
can help to convert the original dokuwiki format to Markdown. It is far from
comprehensive, but should provide a good starting point.
