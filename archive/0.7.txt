====== MyHDL 0.7 ======

Requirement: Python 2.6.

MyHDL 0.7 has been released.

New features:

  * deprecated compiler package -> ast package to prepare for the future.
  * shadow signals and applications
  * better support of list of signals in always_comb
  * doc strings in output, both "official" and other ones
  * new options to control Verilog output
  * docstrings to conversion output, both official and non-official ones
  * support for ternary operator in conversion, requires VHDL 2008 within processes
  * use ''%%__%%index%%__ %%'' method to use Signals and intbv's directly for indexing
  * function attributes as an alternative to magic variables in conversion
  * function attribute to request an instantiation, to make hierarchy support much easier
  * Decide which new Verilog options to keep, add support for VHDL if applicable: custom header
  * re-evaluate initial value for intbv
