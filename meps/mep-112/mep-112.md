Multidimensional Arrays
========================

As of 0.9 (dev) MyHDL has a limitation compared to Verilog and 
VHDL.  Both Verilog and VHDL support multidimensional arrays.
MyHDL does not directly support multidimensional arrays.  In 
the HDL context an array is typcially a homoogenous collection
of multi-bit vector types.

<!-- 
  need some term definition on vectors and arrays, and introduction
  and links to the list-of-signal (LoS) documentation.
-->


VHDL Arrays
-----------
VHDL has many abstraction tools, multidimensional arrays has
existed in VHDL from the beginning.

### VHDL Multidimensional Example


Verilog Arrays
--------------
In the Verilog 2001 standard (1394-2001) multi-dimensional arrays
were added [reference].  Prior to this multi-dimensional arrays 
were not supported and many open-source Verilog simulators still
do not support multi-dimensional arrays [reference].  Although there
is limited support in the open-source tools the 2001 standard is 
over 10 years old and commonly used by many developers.

### Existing Description
<!-- review exsisting options and limitations
md-arrays can be used in modeling, but not conversion
-->

### Proposed Description

<!-- list-of-list-of-signals convertible 
describe how the md-arrays are built and the expected 
conversion results.
