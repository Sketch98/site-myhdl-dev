Introduction
============
This MEP is intended to add support for top-level class methods in conversion.  
Using classes/objects to organize digital hardware can be a natural
and useful development approach for complex highly modular IP.  

In the latest release version, 0.7, top-level class methods are not convertible
by the existing conversion code because the object reference (self) is treated
as a port.  Modifications to the conversion code need to be added
to ignore the object reference argument in class methods.

Example (existing function conversion)
======================================
The "ports" are the signals that connect different HDL functions.
The converter code identifies the arguments of Signal type to an 
HDL function and adds them to the port list.  The
converter also assumes that the ports are the first arguments, i.e. no
parameters before or inter-mixed with the ports.

```python
def adder(x, y, z):
    @always_comb
    def hdl():
       z.next = x + y
    return hdl
```

```python
>>> toVerilog(adder, x, y, z)
>>> toVHDL(adder, x, y, z)
```

Proposed Enhancement
====================
As mentioned the enhancement proposed is to add a top-level class method 
conversion support.  This means that a class 
method has the same capabilities of a current function.  The 
class method needs a set of defined ports, internal signals, 
and generators.

Using the brief examples above a top-level convertible class method might 
look like the following.

```python
class Adder():
   def __init__(self):
      pass
   def hdl(self, x, y, z):
      @always_comb
      def _hdl():
         z.next = x + y
      return _hdl
```
       
The above example isn't a good example why a class would be used
to create, what is often consider a piece of IP.  But it is 
sufficient as an example for class method conversion.

For the above example this is how 

```python
>>> MyAddr = Adder()
>>> toVerilog(MyAddr.hdl, x, y, z)
>>> toVHDL(MyAddr.hdl, x, y, z)
```
   
In the above example with the existing (0.7) conversion code the
`self` argument in the "hdl" class method will be converted to a 
port in the lower-level Verilog/VHDL.

Implementation Comments
=======================

This enhancement proposal is intended to modify the conversion code to support
top-level class methods, so that the object reference (the first argument in a
class method) is not used.  

Top Function Visitor
--------------------

The use of the `self` argument, is only an issue for the top-level class method
parsing.  This is because the parser flattens the design.  A top-level function
/ class method is passed to the converter code, in the function

   _AnalyzeTopFuncVisitor.visit_FunctionDev(...)

This is where the modifications are made.  The modifications only add arguments
to the port list if the argument is of type SignalType.  This avoids the issue
of the object reference being used as port.  The modifications also make it
possible for parameters (non-`SignalType` arguments) and ports
(`SignalType` arguments) to be inter-mixed.

Extract Hierarchy
-----------------

Also, the extract hierarchy needs to be modified to identify the class methods
that describe hardware and determine if the Verilog or VHDL function/method
attributes are present.  The current implementation checks for the an argument
named `self`.  Although this is common practice, it is not enforced by the
Python interpreter.
