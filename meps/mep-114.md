Background
==========

The design approach behind MyHDL is minimalistic: existing Python features are
reused as much as possible, and new features are only introduced when deemed
strictly necessary. However, the design decisions are not always
straightforward, especially because some degree of metaprogramming and
introspection is unavoidable in this project.

For example, early on it was considered mandatory to have support for the
automatic inference of combinatorial behavior. As a result, a function
`always_comb()` was introduced that converts a function into a generator that is
sensitive to its input signals.

Sometimes, new Python concepts greatly facilitate the implementation of certain
features. For MyHDL, the most significant example is the introduction of
decorators in Python 2.4, as a structured approach for metaprogramming. For
example, it was immediately clear that the usage pattern of the `always_comb()`
function matched the decorator pattern exactly. It was therefore a no-brainer to
use `@always_comb` as a decorator instead. Subsequently, it made sense to
introduce a number of  additional decorators.

The feature of concern in this MEP is hierarchy extraction. Here, the historical
design decision was to try to make it transparent to the user. In particular,
instead of introducing specific data structures to facilitate the task, the
Python profiler was reused in the background for the purpose. Over time, it has
become clear that the approach suffers from a number of significant
disadvantages. In this MEP, the problems are discussed and a solution is
proposed.

The problem with hierarchy extraction
=====================================

Using the Python profiler for hierarchy extraction originally seemed like an
elegant hack. As MyHDL uses functions to describe hardware modules, and as the
profiler tracks function calls, the match seemed obvious. However, the approach
has several disadvantages:

* **Non-intuitive API**
As the hardware data structure must be built under profiler control, the API
functions involved need the elements to build it instead of the data structure
itself. For example, instead of: `toVerilog(top(*args, **kwargs))` you have to
use `toVerilog(top, *args, **kwargs)`.

* **Cumbersome error checking**
A meaningful hardware hierarchy implies certain restrictions on the data
structure. However, when using the profiler, data structure building and
extraction occur at the same time. In practice, this makes it hard to detect
certain data structure issues, resulting in cumbersome errors.

* **Normal profiler tasks disabled**
As the profiler is reused for hierarchy extraction, it cannot be used for its
normal purposes, such as debugging, during this process. Understandably, this is
unexpected and surprising.

* **Hard-to-maintain code**
Last but not least, the hierarchy extraction code has proven to be complex and
hard to maintain. It is a part of MyHDL that hampers progress.

In summary, there is room for a more explicit solution that overcomes these
issues.

The @module decorator
=====================

Python decorators have proven their value as a solution for metaprogramming, in
general and in MyHDL in particular. The proposal is therefore to introduce a new
`@module` decorator, to decorate functions that describe hardware modules.

Like before, a hardware description function should return instantiations of
other hardware modules and/or local generators. However, the `@module` decorator
can check the return values, and encapsulate them in a dedicated object.

The advantages of this approach are as follows:

* Issues will be flagged upfront, so that resulting hardware data structure will
be well-formed.

* Hardware extraction becomes a separate, subsequent task that is guaranteed to
succeed. It can be done using a classical data structure traversal, so that
the profiler is no longer necessary. It is clear that the hierarchy extraction
code will be simplified significantly.

* The API can be simplified by directly passing the hardware data
structure to the functions involved.

* Functions intended for hardware description will clearly stand out, resulting
in clearer code.

*Add more details*

Backwards compatibility issues
==============================

The proposed solution has one important disadvantage: it introduces some
backwards incompatible changes.

Let us first make clear what does *not* change: _For simulation, everything will
continue to work as before._ All the simulator needs is a structure of
communicating generators, regardless of how it is built. Old code without the
`@module` decorator will continue to simulate as before.

The `@module` decorator will become mandatory when hardware extraction is
required, more specifically for waveform tracing and conversion. It will be
"viral": when used on a function, it must be used on functions that describe
submodules too, or else an error will occur.

Furthermore, there are API changes as follows:
```
        old API                     ->         new API
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
toVerilog(func, *args, **kwargs)    ->  toVerilog(func(*args, **kwargs))
toVHDL(func, *args, **kwargs)       ->  toVHDL(func(*args, **kwargs))
traceSignals(func, *args, **kwargs) -> `traceSignals(func(*args, **kwargs))
```

The signature of these functions thereby becomes identical to the one of the
`Simulation()` constructor, improving API consistency. Like before, these
function return the hardware data structure itself, so that they can be chained.

Introduction path
=================

The changes are significant but are expected to result in important benefits,
including facilitating new development considerably. The proposal is  therefore
to move carefully but swiftly. In particular, there should be one release that
supports both the old and the new API. When the old API is used, a deprecation
warning will be issued to encourage users to switch to the new API.
