Background
==========

Traditionally, the `myhdl` library is often imported using wildcard import:

```
from myhdl import *
```

The obvious convenience is that all objects that are exported by the library are
readily available. For example:

```
from myhdl import *

@module
def mod(...)

    s = Signal(intbv(0)[8:])

    @always_comb
    def comb():
        i = intbv(0)[4:0]
        ...

    @instance
    def inst():
        ...

    return comb, inst, ...

sim = Simulation(...)
sim.run()
```

The rationale behind wildcard import is that MyHDL is like a mini-language in
itself that exports many objects. At some point, wildcard imports were
considered acceptable in such a case according to some source, for example for
the `Tkinter` library.

However, the [current Python guidelines][pep8] clearly state that wildcard
import should be avoided in production code, except for some very specific
applications. From the MyHDL perspective, the disadvantages are the following:

1. As the Python guidelines state, wildcard import make it unclear which names
are present in the namespace, confusing both readers and many automated tools.
2. There is a chance that Python built-ins or standard library objects are
implicitly shadowed, increasing the potential confusion. Over the years, this
has happened twice already with MyHDL, for the `bin()` function and the `enum`
module.  
3. Some names may have a different meaning in the Python context, adding to the
confusion when used unqualified. Examples in MyHDL are `module` and `instance`.

Furthermore, the argument of MyHDL as a mini-language is somewhat misleading.
It is explicitly the intention that MyHDL can be used in conjunction
with any other Python library, even in unexpected ways. That is also what
users are doing. In such scenarios, it becomes increasingly likely that
wildcard import causes problems.

The conclusion is that there should be a good way to import MyHDL objects
without relying on wildcard import. The goal of this MEP is to investigate the
solutions and to define a recommended approach to import the `myhdl` library.

Explicit import
===============

An obvious way to accommodate some of the issues is by relying on explicit
import of the required names. For example:

```
from myhdl import module, Signal, intbv, always_comb, instance, Simulation
```

This solves the issue of the potential ambiguity of names. However, it has
several disadvantages:

* the import line can become quite lengthy
* any required object name has to be added explicitly to the import line
* a reviewer still sees unqualified names in the code, which may be
confusing

Module import
=============

A straightforward approach is to import the module as is:

```
import myhdl
```

This addresses all the issues but has one important disadvantage: some
code may look heavy. For example:

```
import myhdl
...
    s = myhdl.Signal(myhdl.intbv(0)[8:])
```

As `Signal` and `intbv` are intensely used types in behavioral descriptions,
this is inconvenient and impractical.

A dual approach
===============

To come to a good solution, we can take the standpoint of a code reviewer and
recognize that not all objects  serve the same purpose. Some objects, like
`Simulation` and `toVerilog`, are only used sparingly. Others are used as
decorators on functions. They serve as anchor points in the code and it is
important to define their meaning very clearly. For those kind of objects,
qualified names are appropriate.

On the other hand, types such as `Signal` and `intbv` are used to describe the
detailed actual behavior. In that case, it can be more convenient to use
non-qualified names.

The conclusion is that a dual approach is appropriate, where some objects
are referred to in a qualified, and others in a non-qualified way.

Proposal for a recommended import strategy
==========================================

The dual import approach would consist of two import lines. The first line would
be for the module itself. This could be made more make more lightweight without
jeopardizing clarity by importing it as the shorthand `hdl`:

```
import myhdl as hdl
```

The second import would consist a limited set of unqualified type names from
the library. The example presented earlier would become:

```
import myhdl as hdl
from myhdl import Signal, intbv

@hdl.module
def mod(...)

    s = Signal(intbv(0)[8:])

    @hdl.always_comb
    def comb():
        i = intbv(0)[4:0]
        ...

    @hdl.instance
    def inst():
        ...

    return comb, inst, ...

sim = hdl.Simulation(...)
sim.run()
```

Alternatives
============

An alternative for the shorthand name `hdl` could be the even shorter name `hw`,
that stands for "hardware".

Another possibility is to define the shorthand name as another namespace
in the library itself. This would enable single line imports as follows:

```
from myhdl import hdl, Signal, intbv
```

This would also be more direct way of enforcing the recommended shorthand name.
On the other hand, this approach may be "too clever", and more confusing than
the explicit two line import strategy.

Decision
========
