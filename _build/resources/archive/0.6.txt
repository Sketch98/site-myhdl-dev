====== To do for MyHDL 0.6 ======


===== Status =====

0.6 has been released.


===== To do =====

  * <del> RAM support using array types </del>
  * <del> operators with signed operands </del>
  * <del> augmented operators </del>
  * <del> enhanced ''print'' statement support </del>
  * <del> user-defined VHDL support </del>
  * <del> ''inout'' handling</del>
  * <del> enhance ''toVerilog'' so that it can work with the new verification method also. In particular, ''print'' statements should be handled properly.</del>
  * write conversion verification test benches for some cookbook examples
  * <del> include date/tool info in conversion output </del>
  * <del> review ''if %%__%%debug%%__%%'' functionality with new verification capabilities </del> 
  * <del> encoding attributes to enumeration types </del> 
  * <del> use a package in a separate file for general VHDL output code </del>

===== Open issues =====

==== Name clashes ====

  * Find a good solution to avoid name clashes. In the Verilog output, I relied on using ''_'' as a prefix, but because VHDL doesn't allow this, and I want a general solution, this needs to change.

  * Find a good solution to avoid name clashes with Verilog and VHDL keywords.


==== Rom inference support ====

Currently, ROMs are inferred from case statements, as in Verilog. Users and synthesis tools may prefer arrays of integers. Feedback welcome.


==== User-defined VHDL code ====

<del>It is straightforward to support the ''%%__%%toVHDL%%__%%'' attribute for user-defined VHDL, similar to the Verilog solution. This may not be sufficient however, because VHDL requires instantiated components to be declared in the code. We may have to add a way to add such user-defined declarations.</del>
