MyHDL Project Introduction
===========================
[MyHDL](http://www.myhdl.org) is a Python package that extends Python 
as a hardware description language (HDL).  MyHDL empowers implementation
of complex digital circuits that can be targeted towards ASIC and
FPGA technologies.

[Jan Decaluwe](http://www.jandecaluwe.com/) is the creator and 
[BDFL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life). The 
MyHDL project has been around for many years and has had many successes
bringing a modern and software influenced approach to HDL development.
MyHDL has been used for various FPGA projects and numerous
[ASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit) 
projects [1] [2].

The following are good starting points to learn more about 
MyHDL:

   * [MyHDL Manual Intro](http://docs.myhdl.org/en/latest/manual/preface.html)
   * [Why MyHDL](http://www.myhdl.org/start/why.html)
   * [What MyHDL is Not](http://www.myhdl.org/start/whatitisnot.html)


MyHDL Community
===============
The [MyHDL mailing-list](http://www.myhdl.org/support/community.html) 
and the #myhdl IRC channel on [Freenode](http://www.freenode.net) 
can be used to interact with the MyHDL community.  Most questions 
can be answered in one of these two outlets.  There is also a 
[MyHDL tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/myhdl) on 
stackoverflow.

   * IRC #myhdl channel on [Freenode](http://www.freenode.net)
   * [MyHDL mailing-list](http://www.myhdl.org/support/community.html)
   * [MyHDL repository on github](http://github.com/jandecaluwe/myhdl)
   * [MyHDL on twitter](https://twitter.com/MyHDL)


The IRC channel is informal and typically a question
will be part of a time-limited conversation.  On the mailing-list 
more users/developers will have a chance to comment on the question 
and the question will receive more feedback over time.  

Before a question
is posted to the mailing-list care should be taken to construct a 
useful question.  Simple guidelines for questions on the mailing-list:

   1. Limit the scope of the questions. 
   2. Briefly state what is to be accomplish.
   3. Give a small example embedded in the question.
   4. Clearly state the question in the context of the 
      simplified problem.
   5. It is ok to link original code (or attach) as a 
      reference but it should not be required to answer 
      the question.

Example, don't post code and state: "it doesn't work, help".  
Determine where the issues is and create a specific question 
to the problems independent of the context of the project.
The easier the question is to understand and test (e.g 
removing extraneous information) the faster the question 
will be answered.

Mentors will be in a position to help dig through the project
code.  To get the highest probability of a timely and useful
answer the above recommendation should be used when posting 
to the mailing-list.
       
This exhaustive essay on, 
[interacting and getting questions answered by asking 
well-thought questions](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html), 
is a good guide.


Writing Your GSoC Application
=============================
A [common template](http://dev.myhdl.org/gsoc/gsoc_app_template.html) 
is available to help bootstrap the student proposals.  For more 
information on GSoC see the [GSoC website](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015)
in particular the [student FAQ](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2015/help_page#8._When_can_I_apply_for_Google_Summer_of) 
is a good place to start for new students and the [student guide](http://en.flossmanuals.net/GSoCStudentGuide/)
is a thorough review of the program.

Getting Started with MyHDL
==========================

Using MyHDL
-----------

The [MyHDL manual](http://docs.myhdl.org/en/latest/index.html) 
outlines how to design digital circuits with MyHDL.  MyHDL
[installation instructions](http://www.myhdl.org/start/installation.html) 
throughly cover installing the MyHDL package.

The following
is a list of additional examples and projects that can be used 
as first exercises and references:

   * [MyHDL Examples](http://www.myhdl.org/examples/)
   * [MyHDL List of Resources](http://www.fpgarelated.com/showarticle/43.php)


Contributing to MyHDL Package
-----------------------------
The MyHDL project has outlined a 
[development process](http://dev.myhdl.org/guide.html) 
that should be followed by each participant.  This includes
writing [enhancement proposals](http://dev.myhdl.org/meps/mep-001.html) 
for projects that contribute directly to the MyHDL package.  Certain
project ideas are based on existing MEPs.  The student proposal 
will be natural start to a MEP if needed.

The **cores** developed with MyHDL are intended to be 
incorporated into a single repository [3] at the end of 
the project.


Project Ideas
=============
The project ideas fall into two categories: 

   1. Enhancements to the MyHDL package. 
   2. Implementing 
      [cores](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_intellectual_property_core) 
      with MyHDL.

All projects require programming in Python.


The MyHDL package uses the LGPL license, all work submitted to 
the MyHDL package will be LGPL.


MyHDL Package Project Ideas
---------------------------

### General Hierarchy Analyzer ###
This development is intended to have a single hierarchy analyzer.
This analyzers will use the common components from the rest of the
conversion code and provide additional reusable components. 
This would also support [MEP110](http://dev.myhdl.org/meps/mep-110.html).

This project requires knowledge of compilers and the Python 
compiler support and packages.  This is an advanced project
that will support the overall MyHDL conversion code structure,
reusability, and comprehension.

Potential mentor(s):

   *.  [Oscar Diaz](), *tbd* on IRC and [@dargor0 on github](https://github.com/dargor0)


### Cosimulation Signal Extraction ###
It is possible through the foriegn language interfaces (VPI/DPI) to
extract all the signals in from the [Cosimuation](http://docs.myhdl.org/en/latest/manual/cosimulation.html) simulator 
and
build a `dict` or `object` on the Python side.  Performing this 
action will simplify and automate connecting a Python/MyHDL 
verification environment to a Verilog/VHDL simulation.

This project will require a student to investigate the MyHDL 
[Cosimulation](http://docs.myhdl.org/en/latest/manual/cosimulation.html) and 
research the simulator 
foriegn-language-interfaces, in particular VPI and/or DPI 
for Verilog Cosimulations and VHPI for VHDL simulations
(note Cosimulation with VHDL is not currently possible due
to the lack of open-source simulators with a complete VHPI
or other FLI).  This task requires moderate skill level, 
general simulator knolwedge and will require Python and
C coding.  This work will mainly be completed with the 
[Icarus Verilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/) or 
[CVC](http://www.tachyon-da.com/) simulators.


### 2D List-of-Signal Conversion ###
The MyHDL conversion currently handles 
[converting a list-of-signals](http://docs.myhdl.org/en/latest/whatsnew/0.6.html#conversion-of-lists-of-signals).
But it is ofthen desired to use multi-dimension (list of lists) to 
structure data and/or signals.  This project will involve exploring
the list-of-signal conversion, proposing an architecture for 
multi-dimension conversion, a complete set of tests, and an 
implementation for the conversion.



MyHDL Cores Project Ideas
-------------------------

The following projects are the development and/or ports of common
building blocks used in many complex digital systems.  These are
not intended to be straight ports.  They are intended to be designed
in the MyHDL philosophy bringing many software concepts to hardware
design and creating modular and scalable cores.


### Gigabit Ethernet MAC  ###

This project involves porting a [GEMAC]() core to MyHDL.  The
GEMAC is typically used to *stream* data in and out of an FPGA
versus the lower throughput in common IO Ethernet connections.  

The project has a 
[reference Verilog](https://github.com/cfelton/minnesota/tree/master/test/test_cores/test_eth) 
design and a
[test framework](https://github.com/cfelton/minnesota/tree/master/test/test_cores/test_eth).  
The test framework will be used to validate
the core and encourage 
[test driven design](http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/test-driven-design/240168102).

Like all the cores being implemented in MyHDL these cores should
be designed bus agnostic.  The GEMAC requires in/out data-path and
optional memory-map interface.  If the optional memory-map interface
is not included the default configuration should easily be set during
instantiation.  The core should support many different standards for 
the different type if interfaces.  The following is an example that 
shows how the interfaces are past to the core:

```python
mmbus = AvalonMM(...)
databus = AvalonST(...)
geth = m_eth_lite(glbl, databus, mmbus)
```

```python
mmbus = Wishbone(...)
databus = FIFOBus(...)
geth = m_eth_lite(glbl, databus, mmbus)
```

By using the interfaces and passing the interface types the 
core become truly modular and scalable.

This project requires digital circuit familiarity, ability 
to read and understand Verilog and Python.  Knowledge of 
Ethernet standards and protocols will be useful.

Hardware testing is not an explicit requirement of this project
but would be a great addition.

The potential mentors for this project are:

   1. [Guy Eschemann](http://guy-eschemann.de/), *tbd* on IRC, [@geschema]() on
      twitter, and [@geschema on github](https://github.com/geschema)


### HDMI Source / Sink ###
An HDMI controller sources and sinks a video stream.  The core 
performs the required encoding and decoding to an HDMI link.
It also provides a mechanism to "query" the connected device.

The project has a 
[reference Verilog](https://github.com/cfelton/minnesota/tree/master/test/test_cores/test_hdmi) 
design and a
[test framework](https://github.com/cfelton/minnesota/tree/master/test/test_cores/test_hdmi).  
The test framework will be used to validate
the core and encourage 
[test driven design](http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/test-driven-design/240168102).


This project requires digital circuit familiarity, ability 
to read and understand Verilog, and Python.  

The potential mentors for this project are:

   * [Eldon Nelson](), *tbd* on IRC and
     [@tenthousandfailures on github](https://github.com/tenthousandfailures)

   * [Christopher Felton](), *cfelton* on IRC,
     [@FeltonChris]() on twitter, and [@cfelton on github](https://github.com/cfelton)


### DDR3 Controller ###

The project has a 
[reference]() 
design to port and a
[test framework]().  
The test framework will be used to validate
the core and encourage 
[test driven design](http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/test-driven-design/240168102).
The core port/development should also include the 
[embedded memory test](https://github.com/xesscorp/VHDL_Lib/blob/master/MemTest.vhd)
<!-- todo indentify hardware to test on -->

As the cores project overview description indicates, this is not 
a simple port.  The generated core should support the functionality
of the reference design but the core should also explore creating
a core that is modular and scalable.  It should be explored if 
a single controller can be designed to support multiple interfaces
and standards.  This typically involves advanced usage of elaboration
code.


This project requires digital circuit familiarity, ability 
to read and understand Verilog, and Python.  Knowledge of 
external memory types and memory controller desired but 
not required.

   * [Dave Vandenbout](), *tdb* on IRC, [@devbisme]() 
     on twitter, and  [@devbisme on github](https://github.com/devbisme)


### JPEG Encoder ###
This project is the design and/or port of a JPEG encoder.  Same
as the other core projects, the goal is to demonstrate a modern HDL
implementation usign MyHDL.  Hardware versions of JPEG encoders are
common for (basic) video compression.  The [reference core 
and test framework](http://github.com/cfelton/test_jpeg) is 
the starting point for this project.  This project should 
convert / implement one component at a time.  The following 
is a suggested order of implementation:

    * RGB to YCBCR conversion
    * 2D DCT
    * Quantizer
    * Huffman module
    * Misc: FIFOs, etc.
    * Top-level

This project requires digital circuit familiarity, ability 
to read and understand Verilog, and Python.  


### Leros tiny processor ###

Leros is a tiny soft-core processor optimized for low-cost FPGAs , 
written in technology-agnostic VHDL. The architecture is a 
pipelined 16-bit accumulator, designed with a balance of
logic resources and on-chip memory.

Tiny processors applications include:

* Implement complex states machines with a tiny 
  processor and a tiny assembler program.
* Implement intelligent peripheral device for auxiliary functions.
* Many-core applications and massive parallel algorithms.

This project has the architecture documentation and a reference 
VHDL design to port. The project will include not only the port 
but also the test framework and testbenches in MyHDL to use test 
driven design features. A user guide for the processor core is also 
planned in the project.

Test on real hardware is desirable, in order to compare logic 
resources usage and real performance of both MyHDL and VHDL 
implementations.

This project requires digital circuit familiarity and experience 
with VHDL. A background on computer architecture and 
microcontrollers is desired but not required.


### Other Cores ###
There are an unlimited number of cores that can be implemented
with MyHDL.  Any core can be proposed but will not have the 
existing support as above project ideas.  If a student has a 
particular core they would like to port to or implement with 
MyHDL, start a conversation with the community and generate 
a proposal.
