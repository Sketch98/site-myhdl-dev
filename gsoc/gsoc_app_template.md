## Writing your proposal

You should include the following information in your proposal.


### You the person

Please put this information at the top of your proposal.

Name
* University / current enrollment
* Short bio / overview of your background
* How can we contact you (email, IRC handle, GitHub username, etc.)?


### You the programmer

In your project proposal let us know about your programming 
experience. Don't worry if you don't know MyHDL or git. Many of our 
students start fresh. 

* What platform do you use to code?  What editor do you prefer and why?
* What is your experience programming?  Tell us about something you have 
  created.
* What is your experience with Python?  What are your favorite features 
  of Python that are lacking in most other common programming languages? 
  What, in your opinion, is the most advanced Python language feature 
  or standard library functionality that you have used?
* What is your favorite feature of MyHDL? Demonstrate it here with 
  a cool example.
* Have you ever used git or another version control system?


### You and your project

Answer the following questions in your proposal:

* What do you want to achieve?
* What excites you about this project? Why did you choose it?
* What have other people done on this idea? Has it been implemented 
  before? (hint: it probably has) Are there any papers or blog posts 
  about it?
* How much time do you plan to invest in the project before, during, 
  and after the Summer of Code? (we expect full time 40h/week during 
  GSoC, but better make this explicit) If you plan to take any 
  vacations over the summer, let us know about it here.
* Please provide a schedule of how this time will be spent on sub-tasks 
  of the project over the period of the summer. While this is only 
  preliminary, we will use it to help monitor your progress throughout 
  the program. Also understand that during the project you will issue 
  weekly progress reports against that plan on your blog.

In planning your project, indicate where you expect certain tests
to pass and when documentaiton will be completed.  Also indicate
numerous tests you envision being created for the project.

Please do not verbatim copy text from the ideas page, or from other 
people's discussions about your project, but rewrite it in your own 
words. If you include any significant text or code from another 
source in your application, it must be accompanied with a proper 
citation. All papers or references that you use or plan to use must 
also be cited. Put all this in a "References" section at the bottom 
of your application.

You do **not** need to format your application as a question/answer 
format for the above questions, but we expect to see all of the 
above questions answered in your application somewhere.

A google document is a good place to write a proposal.  All 
potential mentors should be copied (shared) to the document
so they can comment and edit.
