Go to the [MyHDL forum](http://discourse.myhdl.org/t/students-thinking-about-applying-to-myhdl-for-gsoc/164/2)
and introduce yourself and your interests!

MyHDL Project Introduction
===========================
[MyHDL](http://www.myhdl.org) is a Python package that extends Python 
as a hardware description language (HDL).  MyHDL empowers implementation
of complex digital circuits that can be targeted towards ASIC and
FPGA technologies.

[Jan Decaluwe](http://www.jandecaluwe.com/) is the creator and 
[BDFL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life). The 
MyHDL project has been around for many years and has had many successes
bringing a modern and software influenced approach to HDL development.
MyHDL has been used for various FPGA projects and numerous
[ASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit) 
projects [1] [2].

The following are good starting points to learn more about 
MyHDL:

   * [MyHDL Manual Intro](http://docs.myhdl.org/en/latest/manual/preface.html)
   * [Why MyHDL](http://www.myhdl.org/start/why.html)
   * [What MyHDL is Not](http://www.myhdl.org/start/whatitisnot.html)


MyHDL Community
===============
The [MyHDL forum](http://discourse.myhdl.org/) 
and the [myhdl gitter channel](https://gitter.im/myhdl/myhdl) 
can be used to interact with the MyHDL community.  Most questions 
can be answered in one of these two outlets.

   * [MyHDL forum](http://discourse.myhdl.org/)
   * [MyHDL gitter](https://gitter.im/myhdl/myhdl)
   * [MyHDL repository on github](http://github.com/myhdl/myhdl)
   * [MyHDL on twitter](https://twitter.com/MyHDL)
   * IRC #myhdl channel on [Freenode](http://www.freenode.net)

Questions can also be posted to:

   * [FPGArelated forum](https://www.fpgarelated.com/forums)
   * [Stackoverflow myhdl](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/myhdl)


The gitter channel is informal and typically a question
will be part of a time-limited conversation.  On the forum
more users/developers will have a chance to comment on the question 
and the question will receive more feedback over time.  

Before a question
is posted to the forum or gitter care should be taken to construct
a useful question.  Simple guidelines for posting questions to
the community:

   1. Limit the scope of the questions. 
   2. Briefly state what is to be accomplish.
   3. Give a small example embedded in the question.
   4. Clearly state the question in the context of the 
      simplified problem.
   5. It is ok to link original code (or attach) as a 
      reference but it should not be required to answer 
      the question.

Example, don't post code and state: "it doesn't work, help".  
Determine where the issues is and create a specific question 
to the problems independent of the context of the project.
The easier the question is to understand and test (e.g 
removing extraneous information) the faster the question 
will be answered.

Mentors will be in a position to help dig through the project
code.  To get the highest probability of a timely and useful
answer the above recommendation should be used when posting 
to the mailing-list.
       
This exhaustive essay on, 
[interacting and getting questions answered by asking 
well-thought questions](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html), 
is a good guide.


Writing Your GSoC Application
=============================
A [common template](http://dev.myhdl.org/gsoc/gsoc_app_template.html) 
is available to help bootstrap the student proposals.  For more 
information on GSoC see the [GSoC website](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/)
in particular the [student FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#students) 
is a good place to start for new students and the [student guide](http://en.flossmanuals.net/GSoCStudentGuide/)
is a thorough review of the program.


Getting Started with MyHDL
==========================

Using MyHDL
-----------

The [MyHDL manual](http://docs.myhdl.org/en/latest/index.html) 
outlines how to design digital circuits with MyHDL.  MyHDL
[installation instructions](http://www.myhdl.org/start/installation.html) 
thoroughly cover installing the MyHDL package.

The following
is a list of additional examples and projects that can be used 
as first exercises and references:

   * [MyHDL Examples](http://www.myhdl.org/docs/examples/)
   * [MyHDL List of Resources](http://www.fpgarelated.com/showarticle/43.php)


Contributing to MyHDL Package
-----------------------------
The MyHDL project has outlined a 
[development process](http://dev.myhdl.org/guide/guide.html) 
that should be followed by each participant.  This includes
writing [enhancement proposals](http://dev.myhdl.org/meps/mep-001.html) 
for projects that contribute directly to the MyHDL package.  Certain
project ideas are based on existing MEPs.  The student proposal 
will be natural start to a MEP if needed.


Project Ideas
=============

All projects require programming in Python, previous knowledge of 
HDL design, and many of the MyHDL specific projects (i.e. non-cores)
require experience with compilers (familiarity with the Python
compiler package desirable).


The MyHDL package uses the LGPL license, all work submitted to 
the MyHDL package will be LGPL.


MyHDL Package Project Ideas
---------------------------

### Fixed-point compiler ###
This project will develop the backend compiler for the proposed
`fixbv` type.  The `fixbv` has been proposed in [MEP111](http://dev.myhdl.org/meps/mep-111.html).
This project requires extensive compiler experience and familiarity with
the Python compiler packages.  Potential candidates will be required
to complete a pull-request related to the backend conversion before
being considered for the project.

The potential mentors for this project are:

   1. [Christopher L. Felton](https://www.fpgarelated.com/blogs-1/nf/Christopher_Felton.php),
      cfelton on IRC, [@FeltonChris](https://twitter.com/FeltonChris) on
      twitter, and [@cfelton on github](https://github.com/cfelton)


### State-machine conversion enhancements ###
With MyHDL there are many benefits implementing state-machines but
this can be enhanced additional.  This project will implement features
to support efficient and increased readability in state-machines
especially in the case of using interfaces as the control signals.

      cfelton on IRC, [@FeltonChris](https://twitter.com/FeltonChris) on
      twitter, and [@cfelton on github](https://github.com/cfelton)
   1. [Keerthan Jaic](https://github.com/jck)


### Converter implemented in RedBaron ###
This is an exploratory project that will implement subset of the MyHDL
conversion with RedBaron and explore feature enhancement like loop
unrolling.  This project will start by showing feasibility by implementing
current MyHDL features defined by the LRM 

   1. [Henry Gomersall](https://github.com/hgomersall)


### FIRRTL conversoin support ###
Students interested in this project should comment on the the
[discourse thread](http://discourse.myhdl.org/t/potential-gsoc-ideas/163).

This is an exploratory project that will explore using FIRRTL as a
IR in MyHDL.  The benefit would be using the tools in FIRRTL.

   1. [Keerthan Jaic](https://github.com/jck)


### Cosimulaton improvements ###
Students interested in this project should comment on the the
[discourse thread](http://discourse.myhdl.org/t/making-cosimulation-more-user-friendly/136).

This project is an exploratory project and will investigate enhancing
the cosimulaiton interface by implementing a new VPI module in Rust.

### All things waveform viewing ###
This is a core development and peripheral project that will work to
increase tracing and waveform viewing in MyHDL.  The main goals are
to create an efficient waveform viewing with matplotlib and embedded
the traced waveforms in jupyter notebooks.  This has been
[prototyped](https://github.com/cfelton/myhdl_exercises/blob/master/01_mex_shifty.ipynb)
but needs to be extended and needs to be more efficient.  In addition,
the student will explore direct FST support, the MyHDL simulator will
trace directly to FST binary format instead of only support VCD.

### Reduce the amount of global state used by MyHDL
MyHDL uses global variables in many places. Most notably, in the Simulation
module. This is a bad idea for various reasons. The main goal of this project
is to document and reduce the number of global variables used by MyHDL.

Please consult the discussion of the following [rejected PR](https://github.com/myhdl/myhdl/issues/68)
as a starting point.
