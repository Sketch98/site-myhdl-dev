
MyHDL Project Introduction
===========================
[MyHDL](http://www.myhdl.org) is a Python package that extends Python 
as a hardware description language (HDL).

[Jan Decaluwe](http://www.jandecaluwe.com/) is the creator and 
[BDFL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life).  
The MyHDL project 
has been around for many years and has had many successes in 
bring a modern and software influenced appoach to HDL development.
MyHDL has been used for various FPGA projects and numerous
ASIC projects.


MyHDL Community
===============
The [MyHDL mailing-list](http://www.myhdl.org/support/community.html) 
and the #myhdl IRC channel on [Freenode](http://www.freenode.net) 
can be used to interact with the MyHDL community.  Most questions 
can be answered in one of these two outlets.  There is also a 
[MyHDL tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/myhdl) on 
stackoverflow that can be used.

Getting Started with MyHDL
==========================

The MyHDL project has outlined a 
[development process](http://dev.myhdl.org/guide.html) 
that should be followed by each participant.  This includes
writing [enhancement proposals](http://dev.myhdl.org/meps/mep-001.html) 
for projects that contribute directly to the MyHDL package.



Project Ideas
=============
The project ideas fall into two categories: 

   1. Enhancments to the MyHDL package. 
   2. Implementing [cores](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_intellectual_property_core) with MyHDL.

All projects require programming in Python.


MyHDL Package
-------------

### Refactor Conversion Code
This project will involve refactoring the conversion code so more
of the code can be shared ...

<skills and difficulty>
<potential mentors>


### General Heirarchy Analyzer
This development is intended to ... This would also support 
[MEP110]().

<skills and difficulty>
<potential mentors>


### Developer Documentation
This project involves documenting the MyHDL compiler (conversion
code).  The conversion code uses the Python compiler packages.
Both the Python compiler package and the MyHDL conversion code
are poorly documented.  This project would involved generating 
documentation to introduce a potential developer to the Python
compiler tools and the MyHDL conversion code.

This project is perfect for a student interested in compilers
and getting some pratcial experience with the Python compiler
tools.  This project requires basic experience with compilers.

MyHDL Cores
-----------
The following projects are the development and/or ports of common
building blocks used in many complex digital systems.  These are
not intented to be straight ports.  They are intended to be designed
in the MyHDL philosophy bringing many software concepts to hardware
design.  


### Gigabit Ethernet MAC

### Other Cores
There are an unlimited number of cores that can be implemented
in MyHDL.  Any core can be proposed but will not have the 
existing support as above.
